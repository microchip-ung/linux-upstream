Microsemi Ocelot reset controller

The DEVCPU_GCB:CHIP_REGS have a SOFT_RST register that can be used to reset the
SoC core.

The reset registers are both present in the MSCC vcoreiii MIPS and
microchip Sparx5 armv8 SoC's.

Required Properties:
 - compatible: "mscc,ocelot-chip-reset" or "microchip,sparx5-chip-reset"

Optional properties:
- microchip,reset-switch-core : Perform a switch core reset at the
  time of driver load. This is may be used to initialize the switch
  core to a known state (before other drivers are loaded).

Example:
	reset@1070008 {
		compatible = "mscc,ocelot-chip-reset";
		reg = <0x1070008 0x4>;
		microchip,reset-switch-core;
	};
