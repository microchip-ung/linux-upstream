Microsemi Ocelot reset controller

The DEVCPU_GCB:CHIP_REGS have a SOFT_RST register that can be used to reset the
SoC MIPS core.

Since the driver may need to perform a switch core reset the driver
installs itself during postcore_initcall.

Required Properties:
 - compatible: "mscc,ocelot-chip-reset"
 - compatible: "mscc,fireant-chip-reset"

Optional properties:

 - mscc,cpu-reset-only:		At reset, only the CPU will be reset.
				This may be required in order to avoid
				DDR reset on some boards. This is
				opposed to the the default behaviour
				of doing a full system reset.

 - mscc,reset-switch-core:	Perform a switch core reset at the
				time of driver load. This is typically
				used to initialize the switch core to
				a know state after reboot/bootloader
				having used the network interfaces.

Example:

	reset@71010008 {
		compatible = "mscc,ocelot-chip-reset";
		reg = <0x71010008 0x4>, <0x70000000 0x2c>;
		mscc,cpu-reset-only;
		mscc,reset-switch-core;
	};
