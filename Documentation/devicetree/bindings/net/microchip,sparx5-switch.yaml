  The SparX-5 Enterprise Ethernet switch family provides a rich set of
  Enterprise switching features such as advanced TCAM-based VLAN and
  QoS processing enabling delivery of differentiated services, and
  security through TCAM-based frame processing using versatile content
  aware processor (VCAP).

  IPv4/IPv6 Layer 3 (L3) unicast and multicast routing is supported
  with up to 18K IPv4/9K IPv6 unicast LPM entries and up to 9K IPv4/3K
  IPv6 (S,G) multicast groups.

  L3 security features include source guard and reverse path
  forwarding (uRPF) tasks. Additional L3 features include VRF-Lite and
  IP tunnels (IP over GRE/IP).

  The SparX-5 switch family targets managed Layer 2 and Layer 3
  equipment in SMB, SME, and Enterprise where high port count
  1G/2.5G/5G/10G switching with 10G/25G aggregation links is required.
