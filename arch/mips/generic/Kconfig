config LEGACY_BOARDS
	bool
	help
	  Select this from your board if the board must use a legacy, non-UHI,
	  boot protocol. This will cause the kernel to scan through the list of
	  supported machines calling their detect functions in turn if the
	  kernel is booted without being provided with an FDT via the UHI
	  boot protocol.

config YAMON_DT_SHIM
	bool
	help
	  Select this from your board if the board uses the YAMON bootloader
	  and you wish to include code which helps translate various
	  YAMON-provided environment variables into a device tree properties.
