This log keeps track of changes made to non-MSCC files in the Linux kernel.
One could choose to add them using build-system (e.g. buildroot) patches, but
that turns out to be a bad idea when the linux kernel source is built locally
along with the application.

	* drivers/staging/mt29f_spinand/wb_spinand.c:
	* include/linux/mtd/nand.h: Added support for Winbond SPI NAND
	devices in the mt29f driver, alongside MX35 support. The mt29f
	driver this support 3 types of SPI NAND devices with autodetect
	between them. The MX35 driver is obsoleted. Caveat: This has not
	been tested with HW ECC, not with (native) mt29f NAND.

	* arch/mips/kernel/vdso.c:
	* arch/mips/mm/mmap.c: [git changeset: bb234dc] Applied MIPS kernel
	patch that ensures that userland pages use the same dcache lines as
	kernel pages for the VDSO. This overcomes issues with VDSO functions
	like clock_gettime(), which may otherwise return timestamps out of
	order. See also Bugzilla#22868.
