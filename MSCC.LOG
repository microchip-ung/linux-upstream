This log keeps track of changes made to non-MSCC files in the Linux kernel.
One could choose to add them using build-system (e.g. buildroot) patches, but
that turns out to be a bad idea when the linux kernel source is built locally
along with the application.

	* arch/mips/kernel/vdso.c:
	* arch/mips/mm/mmap.c: [git changeset: bb234dc] Applied MIPS kernel
	patch that ensures that userland pages use the same dcache lines as
	kernel pages for the VDSO. This overcomes issues with VDSO functions
	like clock_gettime(), which may otherwise return timestamps out of
	order. See also Bugzilla#22868.
